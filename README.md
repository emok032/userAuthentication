# userAuthentication

Exercising User Authentication Muscles w/ Notes:
-	Back-end (For Login & Registration) is working successfully [using Postman]
-	Next, client-side authentication
-	This my 'practice'-plate for future projects! Never realized how many applications benefit from general user authentication.  So, I'm taking it upon myself to become a "pro" at user authentication starting with MongoDB.
-	It was pretty awesome learning this.  One of my personal takeaways from this is that consistent commenting on old code helps to learn the material better.  Not just commenting as I go but consistently comment after the fact.
-	I've aggressively added notes on this one after reviewing various documentation and tutorials online.  I can't take 100% credit for learning such things.  I'm glad there are opportunities and resources to take advantage of provided by such community-minded people.  So, my notes are info I've comprehended and re-processed from the web and other community leaders (Special shoutout to Stephen Grider for his very helpful lesson).
-	Helpful Tip: I'd recommend drawing diagrams while watching other tutorials.  That always helps me on a conceptual level.

- Database: MongoDB
- NPM:
	- body-parser: 1.15.2
	- express: 4.14.0
	- mongoose: 4.6.4
	- morgan: 1.7.0
	- nodemon: 1.11.0
	- bcrypt-nodejs: 0.0.3
	- jwt-simple: 0.5.0
	- passport: 0.3.2
    - passport-jwt: 2.1.0
    - passport-local: 1.0.0

- Testing (back-end): 
	- Postman (req, res)
 	- Robomongo (database)

- Testing back-end (with Postman): "nodemon server/index.js"
	- Run "mongod(.exe)" & "mongo(.exe)"

- URL (tentative): Localhost://3000

- What's next in my User Authentication quest? *ReactJS + MongoDB*
	- See "Bubo" App for ReactJS + MySQL/Sequelize
	- It was a collaboration ahievement, which I'm really proud of - We'll be adding more features to it in the near future.
