# userAuthentication

Exercising User Authentication Muscles w/ Notes:
-	Back-end working
-	Next, client-side authentication
-	This my 'practice'-plate for future projects!
-	It was actually nice learning this.  One of my personal takeaways this is that constantly return and commenting on old code helps me learn the material better.  Not just commenting as I go.
So I've aggressively add notes on this after reviewing various documentation and tutorials online.  I can't take 100% credit for learning such things.  I'm glad there are so many resources and community-minded people to help someone like me.  So, my notes are information I've processed of from the web and other tutorial leaders.
-	Helpful Tip: I'd recommend drawing diagrams while watching other tutorials.  That helped me on a conceptual level.
