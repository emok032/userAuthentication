# userAuthentication

Exercising User Authentication Muscles w/ Notes:
-	WIP but works
-	I'm particularly happy with this.  One of my personal takeaways this is that constantly return and commenting on old code helps me learn the material better.  Not just commenting as I go.
So I've aggressively add notes on this after reviewing various documentation and tutorials online.  Can't take 100% for learning new things, can you? So my notes are regurgitations of what I've learned.
