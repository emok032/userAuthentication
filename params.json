  "body": "# A Back-End Adventure in User Auth\r\nby Eric Mok\r\n\r\nExercising User Authentication Muscles w/ Notes:\r\n-\tBack-end (For Login & Registration) is working successfully [using Postman]\r\n-\tNext, client-side authentication\r\n-\tThis my 'practice'-plate for future projects! Never realized how many applications benefit from general user authentication.  So, I'm taking it upon myself to become a \"pro\" at user authentication starting with MongoDB.\r\n-\tIt was pretty awesome learning this.  One of my personal takeaways from this is that consistent commenting on old code helps to learn the material better.  Not just commenting as I go but consistently comment after the fact.\r\n-\tI've aggressively added notes on this one after reviewing various documentation and tutorials online.  I can't take 100% credit for learning such things.  I'm glad there are opportunities and resources to take advantage of provided by such community-minded people.  So, my notes are info I've comprehended and re-processed from the web and other community leaders (Special shoutout to Stephen Grider for his very helpful lesson).\r\n-\tHelpful Tip: I'd recommend drawing diagrams while watching other tutorials.  That always helps me on a conceptual level.\r\n\r\n- Database: MongoDB\r\n- NPM:\r\n\t- body-parser: 1.15.2\r\n\t- express: 4.14.0\r\n\t- mongoose: 4.6.4\r\n\t- morgan: 1.7.0\r\n\t- nodemon: 1.11.0\r\n\t- bcrypt-nodejs: 0.0.3\r\n\t- jwt-simple: 0.5.0\r\n\t- passport: 0.3.2\r\n    - passport-jwt: 2.1.0\r\n    - passport-local: 1.0.0\r\n\r\n- Testing (back-end): \r\n\t- Postman (req, res)\r\n \t- Robomongo (database)\r\n\r\n- Testing back-end (with Postman): \"nodemon server/index.js\"\r\n\t- Run \"mongod(.exe)\" & \"mongo(.exe)\"\r\n\r\n- URL (tentative): Localhost://3000\r\n\r\n- What's next in my User Authentication quest? *AngularJS+ MongoDB*\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
